News aggregator website. Development will likely continue with the release of other tools for traders to utilize.

This website will deliver live news directly to the frontend, using Python, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
Currently, it is deployed using Koyeb (free version) and utilizes RSS feeds to source articles from.
Unfortunately a few websites update their RSS feeds once every 10 minutes, and therefore articles are "live" but not really.

Originally, Gamma exposure was a planned addition to the page. However, I have moved on to other projects and do not plan on implementing GEX data.
