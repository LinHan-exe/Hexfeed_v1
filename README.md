News aggregator website. Development will likely continue with the release of other tools for traders to utilize.

This website will deliver live news directly to the frontend, using Python, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
Currently, it is deployed using Koyeb (free version) and utilizes RSS feeds to source articles from.
Unfortunately a few websites update their RSS feeds once every 10 minutes, and therefore articles are "live" but not really.

I will be implementing GEX (gamma exposure) graphing and calculation later, on a seperate page.
